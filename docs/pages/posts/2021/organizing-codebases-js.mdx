summary: "JavaScript or TypeScript codebases can be a hustle to manage. Some people like their spacebars a lot more than their tabs; How can we track changes effectively on each commit? Or how can we automate versioning? We all can do with some standards in our codebase that allow us to keep track of what's going on in them."

# Organizing Codebases with Automation Tools

![Birmingham Museums Trust](/assets/post-covers/organizing-codebases-js.jpeg)

:::tip
  Over the past couple of months, shuffling between different projects, and also work, I found it particularly useful to have some standard
  way to organize a codebase - even if each of the projects differed in some way or another. This little guide is what I come back to
  whenever I'm scaffolding a new project.
:::

## Tools Mentioned in this guide

- [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- [Eslint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Commitlint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commitlint/cli)
- [Commitizen](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commitizen)
- [Standard Version](https://www.npmjs.com/package/standard-version)

### [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/)

Husky is used to make our commits more cool, and powerful to help development easier. In this guide, husky will be used to format both the files (source code) and commits themselves before they are executed (thus "pre" in the pre-commit hooks).

[Read more here.](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/)

- [Initialize Husky:](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/?id=automatic-recommended)

    ```bash
    # install husky
    npm install -D husky

    # initialize
    npx husky-init
    ```

## Prettier & EsLint

If we would like to have our commits automatically format our code on every commit - to ensure that the codebase follows a specified standard, defined in the `prettierrc` file, then this is a handy tool to have.

1. Add Prettier and eslint to your project:

    ```bash
    # prettier
    npm install -D prettier

    # eslint
    npm install -D eslint
    ```

2. Add a prettier [config file](https://prettier.io/docs/en/configuration.html) to the repository - named `.prettierrc.json` (or following the [specified format](https://prettier.io/docs/en/configuration.html) for configuration files:

   ```json
   {
     "trailingComma": "all",
     "tabWidth": 4,
     "semi": false,
     "singleQuote": true
     //more rules below
   }
   ```

3. Initialize EsLint:

   ```bash
   npx eslint --init
   ```

4. Set up ESLint to work with prettier

   Add prettier plugin to the eslint configuration file:

   ```json
   // .eslintrc.json
   {
     "extends": [
       // other extensions,
       "prettier"
     ]
   }
   ```

   Now, you can specify prettier rules to work with your linter and not have both ESLint and Prettier enforcing different styles

5. Add [Prettier Pre-commit Hook](https://prettier.io/docs/en/precommit.html#option-2-pretty-quickhttpsgithubcomazzpretty-quick):

    ```bash
    npm install -D pretty-quick

    npx husky set ./husky/pre-commit "npx pretty-quick --staged"

    ```

> There are more ways to configure your prettier pre-commit hooks [found here](https://prettier.io/docs/en/precommit.html#docsNav).

## [CommitLint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) & CommitLint Hooks

Commitlint is a tool that lints commits - and make sure they are up to standard.
We will also add a husky pre-commit hook that lints our commit messages

1. [Install Commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint#getting-started)

   ```bash
   npm install -D @commitlint/config-conventional @commitlint/cli

   # Configure commitlint to use conventional config
   echo "module.exports = {extends: ['@commitlint/config-conventional']}" > commitlint.config.js
   ```

2. . Add the commitlint hooks:

   ```bash
   # Add hook
   npx husky add .husky/commit-msg 'npx --no -- commitlint --edit "$1"'
   ```

3. Add a husky pre-commit hook config to the package.json
    ```json
    "husky": {
      "hooks": {
        "prepare-commit-msg": "exec < /dev/tty && git cz --hook || true"
      }
    }
    ```

## [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli)

Commitizen is a command line interface tool that can be helpful in making commits a pretty-forward process following your linting rules.

1.  Install the tool

    ```bash
    npm install -D commitizen
    ```

2.  Add a script to the package.json to easily run commitizen:

    ```json
    {
        "scripts": {
          "commit": "cz"
        }
    }
    ```

    An Example use:

<img
  src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MechanicalHuman/hnp-utilities/master/packages/commitizen-adapter/hero.png"
  width="100%"
/>

[source](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hnp/cz/v/1.0.7)

:::tip
You can customize the fields available in your commitizen CLI by <a href="https://medium.com/vlad-arbatov/development-how-to-adapt-a-custom-conventional-changelog-33ff3b13c832"> following this guide</a>.

## Conventional Changelog

This will assist in generating changelogs automatically from commits:

1. Initialize:
    ```bash
    npx commitizen init cz-conventional-changelog -D --save-exac
    ```

## Versioning and Release

We can use [Standard Version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version#standard-version) to automatically generate versions for out projects.

1.  Install Standard Version

    ```bash
    npm install -D standard-version
    ```

2.  Add scripts to easily run releases and generate changelogs automaticallly:

    ```json
    {
      "scripts": {
        "release": "standard-version"
      }
    }
    ```

    Another option to Standard version is [`semantic-release`](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release)

You can now run your first release by:

```bash
npm run release
```

> Plug: Here is an example of a [changelog for my website](https://www.laudebugs.me/changelog).

If you create a release - then you can push that release by running:

```bash
git push --follow-tags
```

<hr />

## Update (25th Feb 2022)
I ended up writing a simple npm package to automate setting this whole process up for new projects
You can find the package [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/organize-codebase).
