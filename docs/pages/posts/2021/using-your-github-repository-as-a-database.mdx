# How To: Use your Repo as a Database with the Github GraphQL API

![Cover Image](/assets/post-covers/using-your-github-repository-as-a-database.webp)

:::tip
You can sort of use your Github repository as a database for your blog posts by leveraging the Github <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/graphql">Graph QL API</a> 😱.
:::

## Motivation

The Github GraphQL API provides a lot more capabilities than I can cover in one _snack_.

However, in searching for a way to share the small lessons that I pick up week in week out, I knew that publishing through [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/), which it the CMS, I use for the main content in my blog site, was a little too much to share easily and quicly.
Posting on Github and sharing that as [gists](https://gist.github.com/laudebugs) seemed like I would be writing too much for a gist that is supposed to be a short code snippet - which was the original title of this section. Although [MichaelCurrin](https://gist.github.com/MichaelCurrin/6777b91e6374cdb5662b64b8249070ea) proves me otherwise! His article is what got me goint in the first place!

## Querying the GraphQL API for posts.

In order to use the Github GraphQL API, you can either use the [API explorer](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/overview/explorer) by logging in through your github account, use an api testing tool like [Insomnia](https://support.insomnia.rest/article/61-graphql), or you can use it programmatically.

Since I was using the Apollo Graph QL library to query my backend - that helps me manage comments and likes, I began to do a little research on how to query the Github GraphQL API. I will link the articles below.
This [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58576940/how-to-handle-authorization-header-with-apollo-graphql) answered how to add an authorization header to an Apollo Client Query.

## The Query

We will be using writing our query in a node.js environment using both [Apollo Client](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client) and [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)

### 1. Obtain your github public access token

The only permission you need for this task is `public_repo` under `repo`:

- [ ] repo
  - [x] public_repo

Give your token a name and will look something like this:

```txt
89fdd35bcd40787b519e97462cec0f9975a66a58
```

Note the token above is revoked and you'll need to generate yours. Once you're done, we're ready for the next step!

### 2. Querying the repo

In my case, I will be looking for files in my repository called `articles`. If you'd like to use your own repository, simply make note of your repository name.

### Using the Apollo Client

1. Install the Apollo client
   ```bash
   npm install @apollo/client graphql
   ```
2. Working in your js file, import the Apollo client and a few methods that we will make use of:
   ```js twoslash
   import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache, gql, ApolloLink, HttpLink } from '@apollo/client'
   ```
3. Initialize a new apollo client with the github graphQL endpoint and your token

   ```js twoslash
   const token = '89fdd35bcd40787b519e97462cec0f9975a66a58'

   const endpoint = 'https://api.github.com/graphql'

   // Add the toke to the header of your client for all your requests
   const githubLClient = new ApolloClient({
     uri: endpoint,
     headers: {
       authorization: `Bearer ${token}`
     },
     cache: new InMemoryCache({
       addTypename: false
     })
   })
   ```

4. Make the query
   I referenced github user [int128's gist](https://gist.github.com/int128/b0e75e3043c8a33808cea0089d988ed3) for the structure of the graphQl query:
   ```js twoslash
   let request = await githubClient.query({
     query: gql`
       {
         repository(owner: "laudebugs", name: "articles") {
           defaultBranchRef {
             target {
               ... on Commit {
                 file(path: "/") {
                   type
                   object {
                     ... on Tree {
                       entries {
                         name
                         object {
                           ... on Blob {
                             text
                           }
                         }
                       }
                     }
                   }
                 }
               }
             }
           }
         }
       }
     `
   })
   ```
5. Parse your output to obtain the file's contents.
   By making this same query on Github's GraphQL explorer, the data returned, which is essentially a json object, at the time of writing this, looks like this:
   ```json
   {
     "data": {
       "repository": {
         "defaultBranchRef": {
           "target": {
             "file": {
               "type": "tree",
               "object": {
                 "entries": [
                   {
                     "name": "QraphQL.md",
                     "object": {
                       "text": "# Exploring GraphQL\n"
                     }
                   },
                   {
                     "name": "README.md",
                     "object": {
                       "text": "# Articles"
                     }
                   }
                 ]
               }
             }
           }
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   So, if to obtain the entries, we would access them by:
   ```js twoslash
   let result = request.data.repository.defaultBranchRef.target.file.type.object.entries
   ```

#### Using Axios

1. Install the [axios npm package](https://github.com/axios/axios)
   ```bash
   npm install axios
   ```
2. Import exios into your node project:
   ```js twoslash
   import axios from 'axios'
   ```
3. initialize an authentication object and the query string that will be attatched to your request

   ```js twoslash
   // The Authorization in the header of the request
   const oauth = { Authorization: 'bearer ' + token }

   // The Query String
   const query = `
           {
             repository(owner: "laudebugs", name: "articles") {
               defaultBranchRef {
                 target {
                   ... on Commit {
                     file(path: "/") {
                       type
                       object {
                         ... on Tree {
                           entries {
                             name
                             object {
                               ... on Blob {
                                 text
                               }
                             }
                           }
                         }
                       }
                     }
                   }
                 }
               }
             }
           }
         `
   ```

4. Make the request, adding in the query and the header
   ```js twoslash
   let request = axios.post(githubUrl, { query: query }, { headers: oauth })
   ```
5. Parse your output as above:
   ```js twoslash
   let result = request.data.repository.defaultBranchRef.target.file.type.object.entries
   ```
